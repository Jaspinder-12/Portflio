### Projects
# 1.  Plagiarism Tool
   Built a plagiarism tool that detects copied or unoriginal content by comparing the submitted
text against extensive databases of online sources and academic papers. Key features include content comparison,
paraphrase detection, and source identification. These user-friendly tools prioritize privacy, ensuring documents are
not stored or shared. They utilize advanced technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand
semantic meaning and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in text. By helping users maintain originality,
plagiarism tools are essential for producing credible writing and upholding academic integrity.

# 2.  Wine quality and House price prediction
  Build these projects Wine quality is determined by factors like climate,
temperature, sunlight, and winemaking techniques. Indicators of high-quality wines include complexity, balance,
typicity, intensity, and finish. Machine learning models can predict wine quality based on chemical properties like
fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and alcohol content. House price prediction involves estimating the value of a property
based on factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. Models use historical sales data and real
estate trends to forecast prices. Techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks are applied to
build accurate predictive models.
